# QFactor and QFactor-Sample implementations on GPUs using JAX
`bqskit-qfactor-jax` is a Python package that implements circuit instantiation using the [QFactor](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10313638) and [QFactor-Sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12866) algorithms on GPUs to accelerate [BQSKit](https://github.com/bqskit/bqskit). It uses [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as an abstraction layer of the GPUs, seamlessly utilizing JIT compilation and GPU parallelism.

## Installation
`bqskit-qfactor-jax` is available for Python 3.8+ on Linux.

First, install JAX with GPU support, you may refer to JAX's [installation instructions](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).
For users working on Perlmutter please use the following modules before installing JAX in your environment:
```sh
module load cudnn/8.9.3_cuda12
module load nccl/2.18.3-cu12
```

Next, install this package with pip:

```sh
pip install bqskit-qfactor-jax
```


# Running bqskit-qfactor-jax
Please set the environment variable XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=False when using this package. Also, if you encounter OOM issues consider setting XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_ALLOCATOR=platform.

Please look at the [examples](https://github.com/BQSKit/bqskit-qfactor-jax/tree/main/examples) for basic usage, especially at performance comparison between QFactor and QFactor-Sample.

When using several workers on the same GPU, we recommend using [Nvidia's MPS](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/mps/index.html). You may initiate it using the command line
```sh
nvidia-cuda-mps-control -d
```

You can disable it by running this command line:
```sh
echo quit | nvidia-cuda-mps-control
```
